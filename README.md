In this analysis, I performed a series of operations on a dataset containing information on avocados. Here are the results I obtained:

Dataset Overview: The dataset was successfully loaded from a CSV file. It comprises several columns including Date, AveragePrice, Total Volume, various Bags sizes, Type, Year, and Region.

General Info: The dataset has a mix of numeric and categorical data. The precise memory consumption and the null count for each column were displayed to get a better understanding of the data quality.

Unique Values: The number of unique values for each column was displayed, offering insights into the diversity of data in columns like Region and Type.

Preview of Data: I showcased a few rows of the dataset to give a glimpse of the data structure.

Subset Data Display: A subset of the data containing the first and last five rows along with the first and last four columns was presented for a more focused view.

Selected Columns: Data from the columns Date, AveragePrice, and Total Volume were accessed and the first five rows were displayed to show their values.

Estimated Revenue Calculation: By multiplying the Total Volume and AveragePrice columns, I derived an EstimatedRevenue column. This offers a potential look into the revenue from avocados given their volume and price.

Grouped Data: A separate dataset was created that shows the average price of avocados grouped by Region and Type.

Total Volume Visualization: A bar plot was generated showing the mean, median, and standard deviation of the Total Volume column by year. This visual aids in understanding the yearly fluctuations in avocado sales volume.

Bag Sizes Analysis: Another DataFrame was created to showcase the total of the Small Bags, Large Bags, and XLarge Bags columns grouped by Type. A bar plot was also generated to visually represent the number of different bag sizes for both types of avocado.

Price vs Volume Scatter Plot: A scatter plot was created for the Total Volume and AveragePrice columns to study the potential relationship between the volume of avocados sold and their average price.

In conclusion, this analysis provided a comprehensive overview of the avocado dataset, showcasing its structure, trends, and potential relationships between columns.
